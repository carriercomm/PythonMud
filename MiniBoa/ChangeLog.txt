game.py

-Added Aliases into the Functions
--Equip and Att Functions now go by the Alias list, so you can do "att Hobo" (For Attack Random Hobo) or "equip limb" (For Equiping the Hobo Limb Weapon, so long as its in the Alias List.
-Fixed a Typo on line 615
-Changed the Weapon Bonus Damage in Attack from Other_Type to Value, I know its a little confusing, Other_Type was designed for the Bitvectors, Value is the Bonus it gives, Cost is the price. I should have worded it better. 

11:00 pm continued

-Added in the send_cc code to send
--Can now use carrot codes
-Display world is only called when needed
--I made it so unless you go to a new location or use the new look funciton, it wont keep re-displaying the world. kept getting in the way when I was playing with it. 
--Done by adding in client.display, if set to 1 the world displays, else it doesn't
--Brought up some minor formatting errors no big deal, I fixed some of those too.
-I didn't get around to it, but the attack function under defs, the Weapon is treated as an object, but not of the Object class, its kind of wierd, but it doesn't take of any of the Objects Class attributes. 
-Added in a smooch action 


--------------------
2/27/2012 - Afternoon - Other Guy
--------------------
game.py
-implemented save function into the client.chat (remembers your equipment now)
-added functions "drop", "take", "use", "remove"
defs.py
-fixed the save function
-added a remove method for removing equipment
-added an armor in my sql
-added in AC to the equip method

**NOTE** need to fix the save function to remember inventory
**NOTE** check your MOBS.db, the column "Inventory" is spelled "Intentory" (I fixed mine with sqliteman)
**NOTE** need to break out of the for loops for our searches. Right now it keeps going even if you find the thing youre looking for
So if you have two medkits, it uses both of them

--------------
2/27/2012 - 10:00pm - Sexy Man
--------------
Defs.py
-Added in Inventory Part for Character.Save
Game.py

#I didn't update the Inventory Table yet, but I plan to
#I also started Bitvectors, put that jazz on the Forums later this week.

DBs
-Changed Character_Inventory, You will need to remake your Character (Unless you want to manually add in "ID Integer Primary Key" at the front, and "Upgrade_Three Integer" at the back. 
-(Need a better Identifier for Character Use than the Item_ID, since you can have multiples of 1 Item, but they might not all be the same - Like my Lightsaber 1 vs Lightsaber 2, both are lightsabers and would have the same ID, but they should be different)
Defs.py
-Updated the necessary places for the new Character_Inventory setup

#An Error I noticed, New Players don't get added to the Client List, I didn't have time to fix it.
#I didn't get into it yet (Not enough time tonight), but the Object class is going to need to be changed a bit to reflect the InvID, This'll need to be planned a bit more, since Mobs wont need this.
#-The InvID (ID in the Character_Inventory) needs to exist to break up the items, 
since as I said about, 2 lightsabers can be different, yet will end up sharing the same spots. So the inventory/Object jazz needs to be restructured, I'll handle this soon.
